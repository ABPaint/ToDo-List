# ToDo-List
### Description
This is a simple fullstack app that creates a ToDo list frontend that will connect to a simple backend.
### Project Goals
1. See how far I can take a simple idea like a to do list and create an frontend that implements all the knowledge I have gained so far.
2. Make a backend that doesn't use S3 buckets because those AWS people keep taking my money.
3. Experiment and improve my frontend skills further.
